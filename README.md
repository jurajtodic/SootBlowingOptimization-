Soot Blowing Optimization in Waste-to-Energy Plants Using AI

Introduction
A Waste-to-Energy (WtE) plant converts municipal and industrial non-recyclable waste into usable energy
through high-temperature combustion. It is one of the few methods to treat waste that cannot be recycled,
supporting a circular economy. This process reduces landfill use and generates electricity or heat, contributing
to sustainable waste management and energy production.
In a WtE incineration plant, non-recyclable waste undergoes high-temperature combustion in a furnace.
The heat generated is piped to a steam boiler, and its energy is used to convert water into steam which drives
turbines to produce electricity. Flue gases from the combustion process are treated to remove pollution.
One of the most common processes in a WtE plant is soot blowing. It is a routine maintenance procedure
that maintains optimal heat transfer efficiency, prevents fouling, and reduces corrosion by blowing high pressure steam in the boiler pipes. In most WtE plants, soot blowing sequences follow a pre-established
schedule.

The goal of the project is to use the plant’s process data to train an Artificial Intelligence model capable
of predicting when soot blowing is truly necessary in each region of the boiler pipes, thereby reducing the
frequency of soot blowing. This reduction decreases the amount of steam used in the process, thus enhancing
electricity production in the turbine and positively impacting the plant’s economic performance. The model
should also consider energy prices at each moment in time to favor cleanings when energy prices are lower.
